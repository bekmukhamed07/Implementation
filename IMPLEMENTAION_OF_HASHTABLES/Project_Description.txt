CS 6301.014 Implementation of advanced Data Structures and Algorithms\
Fall 2013\
Project 5\
Oct 4, 2013\
\
Version 1.0.\
\
Due: 2 AM, Monday, October 21 on elearning\
\
\
Compare the performance of the following hashing algorithms:\
(a) separate chaining with 2-choice hashing,\
(b) open addressing with double hashing,\
(c) cuckoo hashing,\
(d) any other hashing algorithm of your choice.\
\
In cuckoo hashing, experiment with 2-4 tables, and 1-2 elements per bucket.\
Assume that keys are long integers.\
Test your programs on tables of size up to 10 million and propose the\
best algorithm for the problem.\
\
Input: similar format as project 4.  Write driver programs to illustrate\
the performance of your algorithms.  For the best algorithm that you\
selected, output just the number of times that Find failed.\
\
Sample input:\
\
Insert 45267\
Insert 54627\
Find 45267\
Find 54672\
Remove 45267\
Find 45267\
\
Sample output:\
2\
